        <h2>About Cedar Valley Nursery</h2>
        <p>
          Cedar Valley Nursery is a 3rd generation family farm located in the rural parts of
          beautiful Hudson, Wisconsin. We serve Western Wisconsin and the surrounding communities.
          Our family's 17 acre tree farm was created through two decades of planting a variety of
          trees in order to create screens, add fall colors, and attract wildlife on our farm. We
          soon ran out of planting space and had to begin selling trees to make room to grow yours.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cedar Valley Nursery has been growing trees since 1992 and selling since 2004. To better
          serve our customers, our nursery has since invested in a 44 inch tree spade. We are now able
          to offer installation of trees ranging in size from 7 feet to up to 18 feet with up to 5 inch
          diameter trunk. While Cedar Valley Nursery continues to grow trees, we are happy to also offer
          more services to include installing potted trees, shrubs and perennials as well as basic
          landscaping and yard work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cedar Valley Nursery has always prided itself on providing strong customer service. We enjoy
          working one on one with you on tree placement design and to answer any questions you may have
          pertaining to the quality and care of your yard. Cedar Valley is here to help you in any way so
          you can begin to create that ideal yard you have always been striving to develop.
